Certainly! Here are some intermediate-level exercises to practice using if and else statements in the C++ language:

Exercise 1:
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message based on the input.

Exercise 2:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age. If the age is below 18, print "You are a minor." If the age is between 18 and 65, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are a senior citizen."

Exercise 3:
Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers and finds the maximum among them using if and else statements. Print the maximum value.

Exercise 4:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter their grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and prints a corresponding message:

If the grade is 'A' or 'B', print "Excellent!"
If the grade is 'C', print "Well done."
If the grade is 'D', print "You passed."
If the grade is 'F', print "You failed."
For any other input, print "Invalid grade."
Exercise 5:
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and checks if it is even or odd. Print an appropriate message based on the input.

Exercise 6:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year and checks if it is a leap year. Print "Leap year" if it is, and "Not a leap year" otherwise. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

Exercise 7:
Write a program that asks the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle and checks if it is a valid triangle. Print "Valid triangle" if it is, and "Invalid triangle" otherwise. A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

Exercise 8:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a character and checks if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or a consonant. Print an appropriate message based on the input.

Exercise 9:
Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and checks if it is a leap year. Print "Leap year" if it is, and "Not a leap year" otherwise. A leap year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

Exercise 10:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a grade percentage and converts it to a letter grade according to the following scale:

90-100: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F
These exercises should help you practice using if and else statements in C++. Have fun coding!


Exercise 1:
int num;
	cout << "Enter a number for checks if it is positive, negative, or zero." << endl;
	cin >> num;

	if (num > 0)
		cout << "The number " << num << " is posetive" << endl;
	else if(num < 0)
		cout << "The number " << num << " is negative" << endl;
	else 
		cout << "The number " << num << " is zero" << endl;


Exercise 2:
	int age;
	cout << "Plz enter your age:" << endl;
	cin >> age;
	if (age < 18)
		cout << "You are a minor." << endl;
	else if (age > 18 && age < 65)
		cout << "You are an adult." << endl;
	else
		cout << "You are a senior citizen." << endl;

Exercise 3:
int num1, num2, num3;

	cout << "Enter three numbers to finds the maximum number " << endl;
	cin >> num1 >> num2 >> num3;

		cout <<  "You failed." << endl;
	else 
		cout << "Eror" << endl;
Exercise 5:
int num;
	cout << " Enter an integer to checks if it is even or odd." << endl;
		cin >> num;
		if (num % 2 == 0)
			cout << "The integer is even " << endl; 
		else 
			cout << "The integer is odd " << endl;

Exercise 6:
int year;
	cout << "Enter a year to checks if it is a leap year." << endl;
	cin >> year;
    if (year % 4 == 0) {
        if (year % 100 == 0) {
            if (year % 400 == 0) {
               cout << "Leap year" << endl;
            }
            else {

    else {
        cout << "Not a leap year" << endl;
    }


Exercise 7:
